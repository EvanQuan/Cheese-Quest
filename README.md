# Cheese Quest: The Plight of Kashkaval
Cheese Quest is a text-based adventure game, inspired by many of the interactive fiction games published by Infocom. In particular, development was motivated by The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1984).

It was developed in Python from 2016 to 2017, prior to knowing anything about functions, classes etc., while I was taking my first intro to computer science course (CPSC 217). It is all programmed in a single file, and is terribly structured with large amounts of repeated, unorganized code. While it works and is relatively bug-free, it is a clear example of what not to do. The world spans over 100 rooms, and takes approximately 2 hour to complete.
